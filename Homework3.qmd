## Task 1
### Part a
#### We cannot use specifically the read.csv() to read in these data because the delimiter is a semicolon instead of a comma. Instead we must use read.csv2()
---

```{r}
# Read in data
read_csv2("Homework3data/data.txt", col_names = TRUE)
```

---
### Part b
---

```{r}
# Read in data2
read_delim("Homework3data/data2.txt", delim = "6", col_types = "fdc")
```
